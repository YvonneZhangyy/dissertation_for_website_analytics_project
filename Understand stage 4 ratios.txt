Understanding "Percentage Change" in Our Event Impact Analysis
In our analysis, you'll see terms like "Change in Visits (%)", "Change in Pageviews (%)", "Change in Downloads (%)", and "Change in Session Depth (%)". These numbers are crucial for understanding how specific financial events (like earnings announcements or major news) influence investor behavior on Vodafone's website.

What is "Percentage Change"?
Simply put, "Percentage Change" tells us how much a specific online behavior (like website visits) has increased or decreased during an event, compared to what we consider a "normal" period. It's expressed as a percentage, making it easy to compare different types of changes.

How it's Calculated:

We compare the average activity during the "Event Window" (the days immediately before, during, and after a financial event) to the average activity during a "Baseline Period" (a period of typical activity before the event).

PercentageÂ Change=( (Average during Event Window - Average during Baseline)/(Average during Baseline))*100%

Event Window Average: This is the average number of visits, pageviews, downloads, or session depth during the period directly influenced by the event (e.g., 7 days before to 7 days after the event date).

Baseline Average: This is the average for the same metric during a "normal" period before the event (e.g., 30 to 10 days before the event window starts). This helps us understand what typical behavior looks like without the event's influence.

Why is "Percentage Change" Important?
Easy Comparison: It allows us to easily compare the impact of different events or different types of online behavior, even if the raw numbers are very different. For instance, a 20% increase in visits is directly comparable to a 20% increase in downloads, showing a similar proportional growth.

Clear Impact Measurement: It clearly shows whether an event caused a significant boost or a notable decline in investor engagement.

How to Interpret These Percentages:
Positive Value (e.g., +25.50%): This means the online activity increased during the event window compared to the baseline.

Example: If "Change in Visits (%)" is +25.50%, it means daily unique visits to Vodafone's website were 25.50% higher around the event than during a normal period. This suggests the event successfully captured more investor attention.

Negative Value (e.g., -10.20%): This means the online activity decreased during the event window compared to the baseline.

Example: If "Change in Downloads (%)" is -10.20%, it means daily downloads were 10.20% lower around the event. This might indicate the event didn't encourage more content downloads, or perhaps even reduced interest.

np.nan (Not a Number): If you see np.nan, it usually means there was no activity for that specific metric during the baseline period. For example, if there were zero downloads in the baseline period, we can't calculate a percentage change because we can't divide by zero. This simply indicates that the activity was either very rare or non-existent before the event.

Practical Example:
Let's say for a "Quarterly Earnings Release" event, you see:

Average Visits (Event Window): 1,500

Average Visits (Baseline): 1,000

Change in Visits (%): +50.00%

This means that around the earnings release, the average daily visits to Vodafone's website jumped from 1,000 to 1,500, representing a significant 50% increase. This clearly shows a strong positive impact of the earnings release on website traffic.

What's Next?
By looking at these percentage changes, we can effectively measure and understand how Vodafone's financial events influence key investor behaviors online. This insight can help us evaluate the effectiveness of our communications and identify periods of heightened investor interest.
