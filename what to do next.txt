To elevate our Investor Behavior Intelligence solution, we are focusing on two critical areas that will unlock deeper insights and actionable strategies:

1. Advanced Time Series Analysis & Event Correlation
Our aim is to significantly enhance our time series analysis by integrating a broader and more nuanced spectrum of events. This goes beyond simple announcements, seeking to uncover intricate relationships and predictive patterns.

Dynamic Investor Sentiment Analysis: We plan to incorporate external data streams, such as financial news releases, market reports, and social media sentiment, into our time series models. This will allow us to analyze how specific events (e.g., a major geopolitical announcement, a sector-specific regulatory change) correlate with immediate shifts in investor activity, page engagement, and download behavior on corporate websites.

Granular Visitor Journey & Timezone Insights: We will extend our time series analysis to meticulously track the visiting patterns of specific "visitor companies" to "website companies." This includes analyzing their peak engagement times adjusted for timezones, and pinpointing periods of heightened interest that might inform targeted outreach. A dedicated visualization will illustrate these visitor view time changes over time.

Predictive Content Relevance: By correlating various event types with the consumption patterns of different investor clusters, we can refine our understanding of when and which content becomes most relevant.

2. Strategic SHID (Shareholder Identification Data) Integration
The seamless integration of Shareholder Identification Data (SHID) is pivotal. This will bridge the gap between anonymous website behavior and quantifiable investor attributes, enabling a holistic view of investor engagement and its direct financial impact.

Buyer/Seller Behavior & Website Activity Correlation: A key objective is to analyze the distinct website behaviors of identified buyers versus sellers of a company's shares. By fusing click data (CD) with SHID and additional visitor attribute information, we can investigate the connection and differences in their website behavior and actual purchasing activity.

Quantifiable Influence on Share Price & Holdings: The ultimate goal is to move towards actionable recommendations with quantifiable outcomes. Integrating SHID will allow us to explore whether optimizing website content or targeting specific investor groups based on their online behavior can demonstrably influence buying/selling activity (SHID changes) and, by extension, the share price (SP) over a defined period (e.g., 3 months).

Targeted Investor Prioritization: Beyond direct causation, SHID integration will enable IR teams to prioritize specific institutions, individuals, or thematic topics that, if addressed, could positively influence share registers and share price.
