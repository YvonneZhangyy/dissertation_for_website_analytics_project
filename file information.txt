V3-website_category_scrap
This script generates the website category framework (Stages 1 & 2), which is essential for structuring our content analysis. To analyze a single company or URL, simply run the third code block. The first block is for extracting a company's sitemap, and the second is for generating the general framework. Warning: These blocks have been manually fine-tuned and should not be run casually, as doing so may overwrite the source files.

V1_S3_1_website_category_scrap
Similar to the V3-website_category_scrap script, this version is designed for batch processing a large number of websites. To run a batch, simply replace the imported CSV file in the relevant block. To use this file for a single URL or company, change the code BATCH_TEST = True to BATCH_TEST = False. The last block can be slightly modified to merge the files 'visitor attributes.csv' and 'institutionID attributes.csv' with the original data.
